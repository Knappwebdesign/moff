                  <h1>Race</h1>

                  <p>The race:  In 2004, I ran the Marine Corps Marathon and did a one man fundraiser for Curekirby.org.  The responses to my request were wonderful.  After all of the money was collected, I raised over $20,000!  100% of the money supports medical research to help find a cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome.  As a father of two children with Sanfilippo, I have always felt helpless with respect to this disorder.  I could not work harder, earn more money, and maybe pay for a solution.  There is none.  I could and do the best I can for all of our childrenâ€”help them enjoy life, spend time with them (swimming or throwing stones at the creek or skiing after church on Sundays), laugh and cry with them.</p>
