                  <h1>Hello, my name is Hunter</h1>

                  <p>Hunter was not saying anything but “da” and “ba” at 15 months and was over the top active.  We had a feeling something was not right.  He has never been able to really speak, although he did have a small vocabulary and made a lot of noise—really a lot of noise!</p>
                  <p>He has always walked a little funny and has some features that causes one to think that he is mentally challenged.  From an early age though, a passion for baseball was evident.  He would hit as many balls (you quickly learned to use tennis balls and not hardballs) as you would pitch to him.  He would hit for hours.  Hunter was never much on fielding, although he did like chasing four balls from his brother’s games.  Over the last several years, Hunter’s cognitive and physical skills have greatly declined.  He is no longer verbal and is much less physical in general.  He still has a sense of humor and enjoys watching baseball or any other sport that is in season.  He lives at home with us.</p>
