                  <h1>From Stefan</h1>
                  <p>Only being 3 years younger than my sister and 15 months older than my brother, we were all very close growing up. At a young age I thought my brother and sister we both completely normal and I treated them as such. I would annoy my sister and bully my brother just like any middle child would do to their siblings.</p>
                  <p>My sister and I would go skiing every weekend with my Dad to Sawmill and always had such a great time together. When we would watch movies together, she would never let me pick the movie and most times we ended up watching the Sound of Music or the Little Mermaid which I hated, but I still always watched them anyways. Sydney and I for some reason used to like to put things in the microwave together and one time she decided to put a calculator in and it blew up and ruined the Microwave. Our Mom was so mad at us, but it was one of those moments I will never forget. No matter what my sister has gone through in her life she always keeps that same smile that brings happiness to everyone around her.</p>
                  <p>Being so close in age to my brother we spent a lot of time together. We shared a room together until I was 11 years old and it always seemed that we would end up in the same bed together by the next morning. Almost every day during the summers growing up we would play baseball together and I am convinced to this day that Hunter is still a better hitter than I will ever be. Hunter always had an obsession for alligator’s and anytime I was with him and we passed a body of water we would repeatedly say “Alligator in the water” and “I touch an alligator”. Then finally one time we were all together as family in South Carolina and we came a crossed an alligator up close and Hunter ran away faster than I’ve ever seen him run and refused to get close. It was so funny and one of those moments I will never forget about Hunter. </p>
                  <p>I had always noticed little things about my brother and sister when I was younger that did not seem right like the fact that my brother would never say anything to me other than my name a few small phrases. Then while in New Hampshire visiting my Grandma and Grandpa, my parents sat me down and told me about the disease my brother and sister had. I was absolutely devastated, I did not really understand entirely what it meant but I knew that my two other siblings would never have normal child hood and would most likely not be around when I was a grown up. This was very hard for me to accept because I wanted more than anything to have a normal family like all my other friends had. I cried almost every night for the next month just thinking why I was the lucky one in the family to not have the disease and that it was not fair that my brother and sister had to go through this and I didn’t.</p>
                  <p>Eventually I was able to accept the fact that my brother and sister were not normal and there was nothing in the world I could do to change it. This made things a little easier for me but it was by no means easy to see my brother and sister go through their phases of the disease. Seeing the stress that it has put on my parents over the years is something no parents should have to go through. Constantly making sacrifices to ensure my brother and sister are well taken care and have the best possible life. I have more respect for my parents than anyone in the world for the way they have stayed strong through all the tough times are family has faced. They love my brother and sister more than anything in the world and would do anything in their power to make sure they are happy.</p>
                  <p>However, Sanfillippo Syndrome is not a well-known disease and not much research has been conducted to help children who suffer from it. Any donation for my dad’s race would be greatly appreciated so children down the road will suffer less than my brother and sister have. </p>
